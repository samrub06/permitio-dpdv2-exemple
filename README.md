# ✅ **1. Understanding the Problem**

## 💬 Clarifying Questions (to ask the developer):

Check Project/ Environement of the project? 
How is your setup with the PDP container? do you use cloud service (use for experimentation) or Docker

Cloud Service is not compatible with ABAC & ReBAC

Do you have your docker running ? 
// cmd docker ps in the terminal

// What is writen in the audit logs -> Navigate to the Audit log page to see your permissions request results.

// troubleshooting possible 

syncUser vs. createUser
It is important to note the difference between the syncUser vs. createUser functions. While createUser allows us to create a new user, this newly created user will have no role assigned to them. Once assigned a role, a user can perform actions that are permitted for that role. By default, we will want to associate any newly created user with a specific role (Otherwise, they won't be able to perform any actions). The createUser function is intended for specific use cases where we want to create a new user without role assignment.


// it can be when you create an user and check permission, it's maybe possible that the systmene doesnt have the time to update the user 

Send Consistent Updates (Read-Your-Own-Writes)
This feature enables immediate use of newly created data for permission checks. It works by routing data changes requests through the PDP and waiting them to be applied before responding
//   proxyFactsViaPdp: true


1. What is the ID of the user making the request?
2. In which **tenant** and **environment** is the user assigned the `admin` role?
3. Can you confirm that `GET /users` is mapped to a resource in Permit.io?
4. Is your app using `permit.check()` or Permit middleware?
5. Could you share the actual policy you've configured for the `admin` role?

## 🔍 Possible Causes:

| Cause                                              | Symptom                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ User not synced properly                         | Permit doesn’t recognize the user — results in 403 |
| ❌ Incorrect tenant/env in SDK config               | The app is pointing to an empty or wrong context   |
| ❌ Mismatched resource/action names                 | Role may exist, but not mapped to a permission     |
| ❌ PDP is out of sync or unreachable                | Fails silently or returns deny                     |
| ✅ `admin` role assigned, but no permission granted | Policy is missing `read` permission on `users`     |

# 🛠️ **2. Recreating the Environment**

## Minimal local setup:

* Node.js Express app with 3 routes:

  * `GET /users` → admin only
  * `POST /orders` → customer only
  * `GET /orders/:id` → admin or customer

## Permit SDK + PDP via Docker:

```bash
docker run -p 7766:7766 permitio/pdp:latest
```

## Basic SDK config:

```js
const permit = new Permit({
  pdp: 'http://localhost:7766',
  token: 'your_token_here',
  environment: 'staging',
  project: 'your_project',
});
```

# 🧪 **3. Reproducing and Investigating the 403**

### Create a user and assign them a role:

```js
await permit.users.sync({ key: 'adminUser', email: 'admin@example.com' });
await permit.roles.assign('adminUser', 'admin', 'default');
```

### Check permission:

```js
const permitted = await permit.check('adminUser', 'read', 'users');
```

➡️ This will return `false` if:

* The `admin` role has no `read` permission on the `users` resource
* The resource name doesn’t match
* The policy hasn’t been published
* You’re pointing to the wrong tenant or environment

---

# 🧠 **4. Diagnosing and Fixing the Issue**

## 🔎 Most Likely Root Cause:

> The developer assigned the `admin` role to the user, **but did not give that role permission to `read` the `users` resource** in the policy.

### 💡 Fix:

In the Permit Console:

1. Go to **Resources**, create `"users"` with a `read` action
2. Go to **Policies** and add:

   * **IF** role = `admin`
   * **THEN** allow `read` on `users`
3. Save and **publish** the policy

# 📢 **5. Communication**

### 📩 Message to the customer (e.g., Slack or email):

> Hey! Thanks for reaching out.
> I see you're getting a 403 on `GET /users` even though your user has the `admin` role.
> After checking, it looks like the `admin` role hasn’t been granted the permission to `read` the `users` resource in your policy.
> Here’s how to fix it:
>
> 1. Go to the Permit.io console → Policies
> 2. Edit your policy for the `admin` role
> 3. Ensure it includes: `allow read on users`
> 4. Save & publish the policy
>
> Let me know if that resolves it! I’m happy to walk you through it if needed. 🚀

---

### 📈 Internal escalation message (if needed):

> FYI – User is seeing a 403 on `GET /users`.
> Root cause: missing `read` permission on the `users` resource for the `admin` role.
> No product bug, but might be worth improving the error message to explain why access was denied (e.g., “no matching policy found”).
> Suggest enhancing logs or UI indicators for denied checks in the dashboard.
