# ✅ **1. Understanding the Problem**

## 💬 Clarifying Questions (to ask the developer):

You're absolutely right — the issues you're highlighting **are all valid and realistic causes** of a `403 Forbidden` in Permit.io, even if the role seems correctly assigned. Here's how you can turn this into a **strong diagnostic checklist and troubleshooting narrative** in your support challenge or real-world use.

---

## ✅ Diagnostic Possibilities and Explanations

### 🔍 1. **Wrong Project or Environment**

> *"Check the Project/Environment of the SDK vs Permit Console"*

* **Why it's important**: Permit uses a strict hierarchy — the `project` and `environment` are required to match exactly between the SDK config and the Permit.io dashboard.
* **Effect**: If you're checking permissions in one environment, but your user/role was synced to another, Permit will return a `403`.

**Troubleshooting**:

```js
const permit = new Permit({
  project: 'your_project_key',
  environment: 'staging',
});
```

---

### 🔍 2. **Using Cloud PDP (instead of local PDP via Docker)**

> *"Are you using the Cloud PDP or running it locally via Docker?"*

* **Why it matters**: The **Cloud PDP** only supports **RBAC** by default. If you define **ABAC or ReBAC** policies, they won’t be enforced.
* **Effect**: The user will be denied (403) even if the policy seems valid in the console.

**Solution**:
Use **local PDP (via Docker)** when working with ABAC/ReBAC:

```bash
docker run -p 7766:7766 permitio/pdp:latest
```

```js
const permit = new Permit({
  pdp: 'http://localhost:7766', // not cloud PDP
});
```

---

### 🔍 3. **PDP Container is Not Running**

> *"Run `docker ps` to check if your PDP is active"*

* If the PDP is not running or is misconfigured, requests to it will fail or silently return a deny.
* Logs or console will often show connection issues.

---

### 🔍 4. **Use `syncUser()` vs `createUser()`**

> *"Did you use `syncUser()` instead of `createUser()`?"*

* `createUser()` just creates the user **without** assigning roles — which means they’ll be denied access by default.
* `syncUser()` is the recommended method, as it supports syncing roles.

**Better**:

```js
await permit.users.sync({
  key: 'adminUser',
  email: 'admin@example.com',
  role_assignments: [{ role: 'admin', tenant: 'default' }]
});
```

---

### 🔍 5. **Audit Logs → The Single Best Debug Tool**

> *"Check the Audit Log in the Permit.io dashboard"*

* It shows every permission check and **why** it was denied.
* You can confirm:

  * Whether the user was found
  * What policy matched (if any)
  * What tenant/env was used
  * Whether the PDP responded correctly

**Steps**:

* Go to Permit Console → **Audit Logs**
* Filter by user ID or action
* Look at the reason for denial (e.g. "No policy matched", "No such user", etc.)

---

### 🔍 6. **Eventual Consistency – Read Your Own Writes**

> *"Are you syncing a user then immediately calling `check()`?"*

* The permission system is eventually consistent unless configured to **wait** for writes to be committed before reads.
* Permit supports this via:

```js
new Permit({
  proxyFactsViaPdp: true,
});
```

This ensures that any user sync or role assignment is available *immediately* for permission checks.

## ✅ Summary of Best Practices / Fixes

| Problem                            | Fix                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Wrong env/project                  | Double-check SDK config matches dashboard |
| Cloud PDP used with ABAC           | Use local PDP via Docker                  |
| PDP not running                    | Run `docker ps` and check logs            |
| Used `createUser()` only           | Use `syncUser()` with role assignments    |
| User synced but check is immediate | Enable `proxyFactsViaPdp: true`           |
| Unknown cause                      | Use **Audit Logs** to diagnose            |

## 🧪 In Your Presentation or Support Reply

You can say something like:

> Based on your description, there are a few things worth checking:
>
> 1. Make sure the user is in the **same project and environment** where the policy is defined.
> 2. If you’re using **Cloud PDP**, be aware that ABAC and ReBAC policies won’t work there. For those, use the **Docker PDP**.
> 3. Confirm the PDP is running and reachable (use `docker ps`).
> 4. If you used `createUser()`, ensure you’ve also assigned a role — `syncUser()` is usually safer.
> 5. If you’re syncing a user and calling `check()` right after, add `proxyFactsViaPdp: true` to ensure immediate consistency.
> 6. Finally, check the **Audit Logs** in Permit — they will show exactly why a request was denied.

---

1. What is the ID of the user making the request?
2. In which **tenant** and **environment** is the user assigned the `admin` role?
3. Can you confirm that `GET /users` is mapped to a resource in Permit.io?
4. Is your app using `permit.check()` or Permit middleware?
5. Could you share the actual policy you've configured for the `admin` role?

## 🔍 Possible Causes:

| Cause                                              | Symptom                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ User not synced properly                         | Permit doesn’t recognize the user — results in 403 |
| ❌ Incorrect tenant/env in SDK config               | The app is pointing to an empty or wrong context   |
| ❌ Mismatched resource/action names                 | Role may exist, but not mapped to a permission     |
| ❌ PDP is out of sync or unreachable                | Fails silently or returns deny                     |
| ✅ `admin` role assigned, but no permission granted | Policy is missing `read` permission on `users`     |

# 🛠️ **2. Recreating the Environment**

## Minimal local setup:

* Node.js Express app with 3 routes:

  * `GET /users` → admin only
  * `POST /orders` → customer only
  * `GET /orders/:id` → admin or customer

## Permit SDK + PDP via Docker:

```bash
docker run -p 7766:7766 permitio/pdp:latest
```

## Basic SDK config:

```js
const permit = new Permit({
  pdp: 'http://localhost:7766',
  token: 'your_token_here',
  environment: 'staging',
  project: 'your_project',
});
```

# 🧪 **3. Reproducing and Investigating the 403**

### Create a user and assign them a role:

```js
await permit.users.sync({ key: 'adminUser', email: 'admin@example.com' });
await permit.roles.assign('adminUser', 'admin', 'default');
```

### Check permission:

```js
const permitted = await permit.check('adminUser', 'read', 'users');
```

➡️ This will return `false` if:

* The `admin` role has no `read` permission on the `users` resource
* The resource name doesn’t match
* The policy hasn’t been published
* You’re pointing to the wrong tenant or environment

---

# 🧠 **4. Diagnosing and Fixing the Issue**

## 🔎 Most Likely Root Cause:

> The developer assigned the `admin` role to the user, **but did not give that role permission to `read` the `users` resource** in the policy.

### 💡 Fix:

In the Permit Console:

1. Go to **Resources**, create `"users"` with a `read` action
2. Go to **Policies** and add:

   * **IF** role = `admin`
   * **THEN** allow `read` on `users`
3. Save and **publish** the policy

---

# 📢 **5. Communication**

### 📩 Message to the customer (e.g., Slack or email):

> Hey! Thanks for reaching out.
> I see you're getting a 403 on `GET /users` even though your user has the `admin` role.
> After checking, it looks like the `admin` role hasn’t been granted the permission to `read` the `users` resource in your policy.
> Here’s how to fix it:
>
> 1. Go to the Permit.io console → Policies
> 2. Edit your policy for the `admin` role
> 3. Ensure it includes: `allow read on users`
> 4. Save & publish the policy
>
> Let me know if that resolves it! I’m happy to walk you through it if needed. 🚀

---

### 📈 Internal escalation message (if needed):

> FYI – User is seeing a 403 on `GET /users`.
> Root cause: missing `read` permission on the `users` resource for the `admin` role.
> No product bug, but might be worth improving the error message to explain why access was denied (e.g., “no matching policy found”).
> Suggest enhancing logs or UI indicators for denied checks in the dashboard.
